Consider the HMM on the right.

“Rainy” and “Sunny” are hidden states.

“Walk”, “Shop”, “Clean” are observations.

<ol>

 <li>Using the Forward Algorithm, compute the probability of observation sequence</li>

</ol>

[Clean, Shop, Walk].

<ol>

 <li>Using the Viterbi Algorithm, find the most likely sequence of hidden states if we are given the observation sequence</li>

</ol>

[Clean, Shop, Walk].

For both (a) and (b) above, draw their trellis, and show the alphas (Forward Algorithm) and v’s (Viterbi Algorithm), similar to the examples on the slides.
